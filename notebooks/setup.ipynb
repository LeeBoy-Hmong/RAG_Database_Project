    "## Setting Up SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "This is documentation on how to install SQL SSMS (SQL Service Management Studio). Will provide steps on how to provide a mock data to the database. Also, will provide steps on how to authenticate with SQL Server Authentication mode - utilizing a special username for the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to install SQL Server (SSMS):\n",
    "* Install at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install - this will only install the studio manager.\n",
    "* Install the SQL Server Engine (SQL Server Developer) - this is needed to run SQL SSMS\n",
    "* Install both execution files, there is no .msi file to run directly.\n",
    "* Open SSMS - it'll ask you to connect to a dataabse. Perform the following actions...\n",
    "    * Server Name field - put in \"localhost\" - this is the same as 127.0.0.1\n",
    "    * Authentication field - Leave it as Window Authentication (This will change later0)\n",
    "    *  User Name field - should be greyed out and good as is.\n",
    "    * Password field - NA\n",
    "    * Database Name field - leave as default\n",
    "    * Encrypt field - leave as mandatroy, tick the \"Trust Server Certificate\" check box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Mock Data:\n",
    "* Find a mock dataset - importing a .bak (backup) file is what we will be using.\n",
    "* download the bak file into your file explorer.\n",
    "* Follow the path to find your instance of SQL Server.\n",
    "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL17.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\n",
    "* Within the file path, there should be a \"Backup\" file. Cut you bak file you downloaded, and paste it into the \"Backup\" directory.\n",
    "* Go back to SQL SSMS - under your server, right-click \"Database\" and select \"Restore Database...\"\n",
    "* Under the Source field, select \"Device\" > click on the elipses (...).\n",
    "* On the Select backup devices page click \"Add\" > select the bak file  on the right pane > click \"Ok\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker & Metabase Setup:\n",
    "* Install Docker Desktop.\n",
    "    * Also a good idea to install Unbutu - we'll utilize the unix terminal to run most of our docker images.\n",
    "* We can run a Metabase image with the following scripts.\n",
    "docker pull metabase/metabase:latest  # To run the latest image\n",
    "docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name Metabase metabase/metabase  # Run the image in a container.\n",
    "* In Docker - on the left-hand pane, select Container > Access the web portal via click on the port number \"3000:3000\"\n",
    "* \n"
